<h2>& her reasons why</h2>
<hr />
<h2>The Awakening</h2>
<p>As a young woman this book was extremely powerful in recognizing one's own identity and not losing oneself in motherhood which is so often done</p>
<h2>Monster</h2>
<p>This book is written in such a unique style and perspective that it is hard to forget</p>
<h2>The Book Thief</h2>
<p>I don't want to spoil too much, but this is a book I wish I could read for the very first time again</p>
